# Team Overview

We are **BrightWay**, a passionate team of five **FPT University** students participating in the **AI Agent for SDLC Hackathon**, competing under **Track 1 – Topic 2: Testing, Execution & Reporting App.**

Our mission is to build an **AI-powered Testing, Execution & Reporting Platform** that empowers development teams to automate test execution, generate insightful reports, and continuously improve software quality.

Leveraging intelligent analysis and automation, our app detects anomalies, test failures, and performance bottlenecks in real time — providing **smart recommendations, detailed reporting, and analytics dashboards** that streamline the entire testing lifecycle.
